            <ol>
                <li>This is element one and we dont want to select this.</li>
                <li>This is element two and this has two unordered list in it.</li>

                    <li>and this one as well.</li>
                    <li>These are immediate descendants of the list that is why we used ul > li. If we wanted to color all the descendants then
                        we would write ul li without the '>'
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>This is the last element and we dont want to select this.</li>
